1. Sir, I think my greatest strength is my positive attitude even during the hardest times.
   During my college project, we faced certain difficulties in implementing the project and my teammates were frustrated.
   At that time I had to believe and think positively to motivate my teammates and ultimately we completed that project successfully.
