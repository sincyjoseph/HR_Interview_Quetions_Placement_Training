1. Frankly speaking, no one wants to work on nights and weekends.
   Because we have our loved ones (parents, wife) who are thinking that at least at night and weekends I am free and I can devote my time to them and make them feel happy. 
   But if it is about our company reputation then I am ready to work at night because after all, our company is also my family because
   it gives me status, reputation, money which makes our loved ones too proud.
